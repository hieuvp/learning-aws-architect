## AWS Account

### Dashboard

### Users

Create users if you want to grant other users access to your AWS account without sharing your login credentials.

### Groups

Groups make it easy to manage access for multiple users.

### Roles

Roles are similar to users as they hold an AWS identity with permissions.
Roles are often used if you e.g. want to grant access to AWS resources that the user normally does not have.

Another scenario would be that you want to grant an application access to your AWS resources without exposing your AWS credentials.

### Policies

### Identity providers

Identity providers enables you to let users gain access to your AWS resources with the help of an external identity provider (IdP).
You may have used an external identity providers in the past if you've used your GitHub or Facebook account to sign in to another website.
